/*

Set up our "claim conditions"
What's the max # of NFTs that can be minted? When can users start minting NFTs? 
Again, this is usually custom logic you'd need to write into your contract but in this case thirdweb makes it easy. 
We can just use their newClaimPhase function and specify a few parameters.
